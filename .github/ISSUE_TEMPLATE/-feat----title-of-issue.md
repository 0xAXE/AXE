Implement a secure water-management smart contract that tracks and incentivizes efficient water usage in agriculture.  

This contract should:  

- Record water consumption per parcel/crop using IoT sensor data.  
- Store summaries on-chain and reference detailed data off-chain via IPFS hashes.  
- Allow thresholds to be set for acceptable consumption levels.  
- Issue incentives (loyalty tokens) for efficient water usage.  
- Generate alerts for excessive water consumption.  
- Provide farmer/parcel usage reports for regulatory compliance.  
- Ensure secure oracle integration for sensor data.  
- Be designed for scalability across multiple farmers and parcels.

üìÅ Files to Modify  
- `src/lib.rs` (exports, configuration)  
- `src/water_usage.rs` (tracking water usage)  
- `src/incentives.rs` (incentive distribution logic)  
- `src/alerts.rs` (consumption alert generation)  
- `src/utils.rs` (oracle integration, validation helpers)  
- `Makefile` (build + deployment automation)  
- `README.md` (documentation & usage guide)  

---

‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria  

- [ ] Contract tracks water usage per parcel/crop with IoT oracle data.  
- [ ] Summaries stored on-chain; detailed data referenced via IPFS hash.  
- [ ] Incentives issued only when consumption within thresholds.  
- [ ] Alerts emitted when consumption exceeds limits.  
- [ ] Thresholds configurable by contract admin.  
- [ ] Usage reports retrievable for any farmer or parcel.  
- [ ] Events emitted for `record_usage`, `issue_incentive`, and `generate_alert`.  
- [ ] Coverage includes success paths, access control, threshold violations, and concurrency edge cases.  
- [ ] `cargo build`, `stellar contract build`, and `cargo test` pass successfully.

‚ö† Notes  
- Integration with **environmental-impact-tracking** contract for sustainability reports.  
- Future support for regional water policies.  
- Incentives integrate with **loyalty-token-contract**.  
- Ensure event schema matches reporting requirements.
