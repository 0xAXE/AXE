<h1 align="center"> AXE </h1>

### 🔹 Description:

---

**Axe** is a universal identity layer for Web3 that replaces fragmented wallet addresses with a single, powerful **User ID** — enabling seamless **sending and receiving of assets** across multiple blockchains.

Whether you're receiving ETH from Ethereum, USDC from Solana, or USDT on Polygon — just share your AxeGate ID. The system intelligently routes each asset to the correct destination wallet. And when you want to send assets, AxeGate lets you simply input the recipient’s ID or Address — and it handles the cross-chain delivery under the hood.

No more managing multiple wallets. No more errors. Just one ID — and full cross-chain functionality.
